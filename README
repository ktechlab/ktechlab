KTechLab
=============

KTechLab is an IDE for microcontrollers and electronics.
It supports circuit simulation,
program development for microcontrollers and
simulating the programmed microcontroller together with its application circuit.

- the official communucation channel is hosted on sourceforge,
        it is called ktechlab-devel
    - link to archives of the list:

- on IRC, KTechLab developers regularly join the channel
    #ktechlab, on FreeNode

Getting the source
------------------

KTechLab's source code is located in GIT repositories.

The official repository is located on github:

- https://github.com/ktechlab/ktechlab

- the master branch contains the latest tested development code,
    while other branches might contain untested/unstable code

Other notable GIT repositories are located on sourceforge:

- main KTechLab repository:
    - `git://ktechlab.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ktechlab/ktechlab`
    - contains the contents of the previously used SVN repository

- developers' own repositories:
    - git://ktechlab.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ktechlab/ktl-alonzotg
    - git://ktechlab.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ktechlab/ktl-j_ohny_b
    - git://ktechlab.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ktechlab/ktl-zoltan_p
        - the master branch should have the same content as the
            official master branch from github
    - these repositories contain work-in-progress code,
        which is supposed to be merged in the master branch on github

Checking out from GIT can be performed with the following commands:

    git clone git://github.com/ktechlab/ktechlab.git
    cd ktechlab
    git checkout -b master --track origin/master


Building
-------------------

Required dependencies

- Qt4 -dev
- cmake
- glib -dev

Optional dependencies

- KDE4 libraries -dev
- KDevPlatform libraries -dev
    - NOTE: without the following two components, only the unit test
        will be built; those are not useful for end-users
- GPSim -dev, for microcontroller support
