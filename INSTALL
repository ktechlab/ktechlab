Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

cmake doesn't produce any output into the source directory, by default. 
Instead it uses extra build directories for that. (This makes the 
make clean procedure obsolete, because you only have to remove the build dir)

To compile this project, simply create a build dir:

mkdir build

#cd into the build dir
cd build

#run cmake to do the "configure magic" 
#(yes, the two dots point to the source dir)
cmake ..

#make
make

#and make install
make install


Compilers and Options
=====================

Compiler options can be set via ccmake or directly as a command-line option
for cmake. The most easy way would be to use ccmake.

To compile in debug symbols use:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug ..

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `cmake' the
option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH'.

Optional Features
=================

{TODO}

Operation Controls
==================

Some interesting cmake variables include:

	-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
		This makes cmake to create verbose Makefiles to see options given
		to gcc and friends
