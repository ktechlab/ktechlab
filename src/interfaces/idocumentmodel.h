 * as \ref QVariantMap and must at least have a value for the "id" key and a unique
 * id stored as it's value.

 * and valid connectors at all other positions if there is a connection between the components
 * corresponding to the rows and columns of the matrix. So, if there is a connection from
 * the component at (i,i) to the component at (j,j) there will be valid data for
