/**
This class performs matrix storage, lu decomposition, forward and backward
substitution, and a few other useful operations. Steps in using class:
(1) Create an instance of this class with the correct size
(2) Define the matrix pattern as neccessary:
	(1) Call zero (unnecessary after initial ceration) to reset the pattern
		& matrix
	(2) Call setUse to set the use of each element in the matrix
	(3) Call createMap to generate the row-wise permutation mapping for use
		in partial pivoting
(3) Add the values to the matrix
(4) Call performLU, and get the results with fbSub
(5) Repeat 2, 3, 4 or 5 as necessary.
@todo We need to allow createMap to work while the matrix has already been initalised
@short Matrix manipulation class tailored for circuit equations
