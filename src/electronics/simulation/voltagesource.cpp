/* FIXME:
	Often times, you want to use one of these to set a voltage in a circuit but not pass
current. This creates a singular matrix. Depending on how Matrix is set up, it might either cause the
circuit to glitch out or will create a virtual one ohm resistor either into a component that shouldn't be conducting and draw/source that current from wherever it is avaliable. =P

VoltageSignal also exhibits this problem.
